			<!-- RELEVANT SKILLS -->
			<section id="relevant-skills" class="relevant-skills">
				<div class="content-wrap">				
					<h2>Relevant Skills</h2>

					<div class="item">					
						<h3>Communication Skills</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Conveyed complex topics to non-/expert audiences ranging from small groups up to 300 people; invited to present at international conferences; earned several top prizes for effectively communicating my findings.</li>
							<li>Written up scientific findings for publication in several peer-reviewed scientific journals; written up and defended my graduate thesis.</li>
							<li>Negotiated permission from my employer to work on an independent project during regular working hours; negotiated for funding (total of > $47,000)</li>
							<li>Learned to communicate with people across a wide range of roles, ranging from my employees and clients as an entrepreneur as well as my trainees, peers and supervisors as a scientist</li>	
						</ul>				
					</div>
					<div class="item">					
						<h3>Business Awareness</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>As a founder of a small business I sought out clients, maintained client relationships, recruited employees, designed and implemented marketing strategies, managed sales and accounting, thus gaining insights into several key aspects of business organisation.</li>
							<li>Participated in several selective workshops by McKinsey & Company, one of top business consulting companies, focused on problem-solving strategies for large businesses.</li>
						</ul>				
					</div>
					<div class="item">					
						<h3>Intellectual Curiosity</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>As a postdoctoral fellow I continuously carved out the time to attend seminars outside of my field of research.</li>
							<li>One of these seminars sparked my interest in a recently discovered protein which I researched in my free time, developed into a project and presented my findings at a scientific conference generating interest of my peers and resulting in further collaborative work.</li>
						</ul>				
					</div>
					<div class="item">					
						<h3>Analytical & Statistics Skills</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>During my academic career I located and assimilated new information rapidly, synthesized complex information; designed scientific experiments to test hypotheses; collected and analysed data using appropriate statistical methods (t-tests, linear regression, ANOVA and SPSS software); encountered and solved problems; reached independent conclusions, presented and defended them.</li>
						</ul>				
					</div>
					<div class="item">					
						<h3>Programming & Data Science Skills</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Created several websites using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and jQuery.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I created a couple of websites. The first is very basic and almost ungly looking <a href="http://www.barboradoslikova.com/blood-types">Blood Types</a> with a non-functional menu, while the second one is more enjoyable to look at <a href="http://www.barboradoslikova.com/games-website">Games Website</a> and allows you to have some fun with the games, especially The Magical Forest. However, it could certainly be improved, for example by adding error handling.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Taught myself basics of Python, SQL, and Windows and Unix command line.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>I've also written a couple of simple scripts. Comparing <a href="https://github.com/BarboraDoslikova/pyg-latin-translator/blob/master/pyg_latin_translator.py">Version 1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/BarboraDoslikova/pyg-latin-translator-v2/blob/master/pyg_latin_translator_v2.py">Version 2</a> lets you see my progress; functions in the latter are going in the right direction of modularity and hence reusability.</li>
									<li>Do you want to ship books? Is is discounted? Do you want to ship the first x number of books for $xx.xx and the next y number of books for $yy.yy? The <a href="https://github.com/BarboraDoslikova/pyg-latin-translator/blob/master/pyg_latin_translator.py">Total Price Calculator</a> will tell you how much it will cost you.</li>
								</ul>
							<li>Investigated trends in Icelandic accidents using pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, seaborn and Tableau and <a href="https://github.com/BarboraDoslikova/health-Iceland">published them</a> using IPython Notebook on GitHub.</li>

							<h3>Postdoctoral Research Fellow</h3>
							<h4 class="company">University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada</h4>
							<p class="date">August 2014 - Present</p>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>My postdoctoral work focused on the role of the brain in cancer-related wasting (characterised by appetite, fat and muscle loss) which occurs in most and kills 30% of cancer patients.</p>
							<p>I found that presence of the tumor coincides with dramatic changes in brain cells, which regulate appetite and influence fat and muscle. Therefore, these cells appear to be promising candidates for further investigation of the still unclear mechanism of cancer-related wasting.</p>

					<h2>Education</h2>

						<div class="details">
							<h3>Doctor of Philosophy in Neuroscience</h3>
							<h4>University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK</h4>
							<p class="date">2010 - 2014</p>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>My graduate work focused on how the brain controls our appetites. I found that a combination of two agents is synergistically more effective in appetite reduction than each one on their own. This could potentially allow either (1) for reduced severity and/or number of side effects of a certain (serotonin-based) class of obesity drugs if the current doses were used or (2) for greater efficacy using higher doses.</p>
							<p>These findings were published in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23739976">a scientific journal</a> and I was invited to present them at several local and international conferences where they generated a lot of interest from pharmacological companies.</p>
							<p>I contributed to projects published in several other scientific journals, won funding of over ~ 40,700 USD and several top presentation prizes.</p>

							<h3>Master of Philosophy in Clinical Biochemistry</h3>
							<h4>University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK</h4>
							<p class="date">2009 - 2010</p>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>Among other projects, I helped to ellucidate the function of a protein whose genetic variation is the most common genetic variation which increases our risk of obesity.</p>

						<div class="details">
							<h3>Bachelor of Science in Human Nutrition (First Class Honours)</h3>
							<h4>University of Westminster, London, UK</h4>					
							<p class="date">2006 - 2009</p>
						</div>
						<div class="description">
							<p>From the very start of my undergraduate studies, I sought to undertake relevant research experience, totalling 19 months of work in 4 different projects over the 3 years of studies.</p>
							<p>I was rewarded for my academic excellence by 3 local and 1 national awards and graduated with First Class honours.</p>
							<p>These accomplishments helped me to win a student laboratory experience grant from the British Society for Neuroendocrinology (~5,500 USD) for an 8-week summer project at the prestigious MRC National Institute for Medical Research.</p>
							<p>During this time, I also set up a business of my own, whereby in 2008 I led a team of up to 9 workers providing services to 4 companies (including CNN).</p>
